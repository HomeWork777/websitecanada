    During all these years within these different organizations and agencies, she realized that it was difficult to offer specific care to each beneficiary and it was even more difficult to give them the time they need and deserve. It is for this reason that she is set up as a private home care agency to be able to provide adequate care, the time required, and to build bonds of trust with each of them",
